There are many different ways to use uppercase and lowercase letters along 
with symbols to indicate the purpose and context of your named entities.

## Case Indicators

### Camel Case

Some languages like Java use camel case for many types of methods and 
variables while others utilize the case for indicative purposes. In Python,
camel case is used for object methods and variables while snake case is used
for general methods and variables. 

### Pascal Case

Used from the PASCAL language.
The first letter of each word is capitalized.
Pascal's wager is a famous argument for belief in God. It is a wager that
believing in God is the best bet because if God does not exist, then you
lose nothing in death by believing in God. If God does exist and you believe,
then you can enter the kingdom of heaven. If God does not exist and you do not
believe, you lose your spot in paradise. The wager is to believe in God 
regardless for the benefit of the afterlife. Remembering this wager indicates
to capitalize the works of God by using uppercase to indicate the importance
of the word. This is how pascal case can be remembered, when writing a word
in pascal case, we capitalizing the first letter of each variable just as one
uppercase the name of God.
