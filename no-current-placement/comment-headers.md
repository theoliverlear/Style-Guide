comment headers, defined organization

A majorly important tenet of this book is about organization. It is key to 
know where groups of things belong and how they're related. A major identifier
for this is comment headers. A comment header is defined as:

    "A comment line which describes the item(s) below it, typically reaching
     line length and divisive characters."

This is a simple and broad definition for what can be considered a simple and
wide-ranging topic. Before discussing comment headers, let's see some 
examples.
