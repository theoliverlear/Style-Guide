**Welcome to the Style Guide!**

    Code is for computers. Programs are for people.

My life's work has gone into making code that is optimial, readable, and 
maintainable. This book, "Style Guide", is a collection of my thoughts on how
to program with style and elegance. The book not only aims to teach you how to
write good code, but hopefully convince you that it is worth the effort.
