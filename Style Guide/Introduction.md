This is the first commit for the style guide. Ideas, chapters, and examples are soon to come!

# this is the brainstorm section where I note my raw thoughts and ideas
# more structure is seen in the TableOfContents.md file

license in code vs license in repository

common coding terms used-- a glossary of terms (perhaps an index too)
Variable names
Line width (79, 49) -- look up screen widths and max text space available fullscreen and halfscreen
temporary local variables
order/structure of methods
commend header distinctions
try/catch vs throws (looping, exception handling)
maybe primitives vs objects ex String[] vs StringTokenizer
when to do comments inline vs newline
block comments vs brief, low visual cost comments
when to use keywords like "method" or "section" in comment heading
when should headings occur

how much of the time will the user be in front of the code vs program independence
-- how do we account for these different situations (error handling)

Unplugged privilege: the advantage of having skills to independently or innately
solve problems without the advantate of plugged-in privileges
- Coding interviews advantage -- they have unplugged programming

Shining variable: a variable which is used as a focal point for a program -- why are they important
how do we handle them

the value of consistency and when to break it and why breaking it can add value
the exception can add just as much as the rule

keep in mind the keywords of the chapter and section when writing. reiterate without repeating (maybe)

chatGPT says "Remember, the primary purpose of comments is to communicate the intent and 
functionality of your code effectively. Special characters should be used sparingly and in a way that 
supports readability rather than distracting from it."

cite your sources, quotes, influences, examples, ect. 
"taking influence from {book} by {author}" it is best pracice to do {thing} this way
--example from {book} by {author}, chapter, page


organizing library, imports, and directories
how people read -- up down left right and when thats not the case
capitalization and case consistency with purpose
retrieving a boolean before an action or durinng it liuke has ennough money on the call or duing it
when naming variable based on what it is and how it will be used
if shortening a variable name, it should be readily apparent what it is with the new name
ex. g not redibily apparent for graphics but graphics graphs may be better
ex connection can be shortened to conn 
for the most part, using named variables in loops, like while, are best to 
understand the conditions as opposed to having to direct each condition -- in short, it should give a general
idea where just while (true) does not
When to have spaces between things like methods() and keywords like while ()

When to printstacktrace (long and continues program) vs a named throw like a RuntimeException 
(specific and stops execution)
emergencies -â€” when to use system.exit()
Checking for outliers and how to add that to program without confusing boilerplate 
(separation, perhaps a (static?) Utilities class)

the anatomy of a comment, the scope implied by a comment, block vs inline comments (when and why)
when to have a new variable -- a new idea or concept, a new use case, 
general test naming structure, use common pracice of variables and methods testThing
and class and directories ThingTest

Long arguments list, when to press enter, and how/when to line up the entered code -- 
what artifacts do you base the indentation on

the difference in conventions between languages -- statically typed vs dynamically 
typed (names of variables, methods, classes, ect)

---python---
when to use underscore or snake case vs camel vs pascal (general methods, variables,
object orientation, classes and exceptions)
--javascript--
elements of HTML id/class into javascript (safe or different naming convention (what and why change or not))
--HTML--
when to use respective naming in ids and classes and how it connects code like javascript and its conventions
--CSS--
ordering of CSS selectors and how to organize them -- visual hierarchy vs similarity/relationship hierarchy
unique position as a typically split or half screen language (why the 49)
CSS deals with already declared variables -- how does that affect the code style
